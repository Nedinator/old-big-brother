## Get this bot
> <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=593429048106025000&permissions=2176&scope=bot">Click this</a> to invite this discord bot to your server. This requires permissions to read audit logs to log the reason of kicks/bans in your server. I may change this to optional later on.  

## Commands

1. !alerts <on/off> - Activate alerts for your server and be notified how many kicks and bans users joining have.
2. !config <admin/alert> <channel id> - Set up admin channel and alert channels.
3. !history <kick/ban> <user id> - Get the history of a user in your server. To use this, the bot must have permission to view audit logs and the user must be in your server.
